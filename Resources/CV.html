        <p>
            I'm an active person, I've always been practicing some kind of sport, used to play volleyball, now lifting weights and jogging.
            I like working with photoshop and blender, designing games, although I never find enough time to complete and release one.
            I was into music in my childhood, I can play Piano and Guitar.
            I like learning languages, memorizing words is something how I keep my brain active, currently I'm learning Spanish.'
            One of my hobbies is to go bushcrafting and camping. I camped in a forest for 4 days, with food and water, limited gear, no tent.
            I'm surprised you've reached this far, why don't you invite me for an interview then? :)
